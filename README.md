# ALL CHEAT SHEET
Data Science is an ever-growing field, there are numerous tools & techniques to remember. It is not possible for anyone to remember all the functions, operations and formulas of each concept. Thatâ€™s why we have cheat sheets. But there are a plethora of cheat sheets available out there, choosing the right cheat sheet is a tough task. So, I decided to write this article.

Here I have selected the cheat sheets on the following criteria: comprehensiveness, clarity, and content.

After applying these filters, I have collated some 28 cheat sheets on machine learning, data science, probability, SQL and Big Data. For your convenience, I have segregated the cheat sheets separately for each of the above topics. There are cheat sheets on tools & techniques, various libraries & languages.
